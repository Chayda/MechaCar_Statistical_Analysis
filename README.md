# MechaCar_Statistical_Analysis
Performing statistical analysis for fictitious car manufacturer AutosRUs for a prototype called MechaCar, to see if there are variables that affect the vehiclesâ€™ performance using two separate datasets.
The mpg dataset (MechaCar_mpg.csv) contains the following variables: vehicle_length, vehicle_weight, spoiler_angle, ground_clearance, AWD (All-Wheel Drive), and mpg (miles per gallon).
The suspension coil dataset (Suspension_Coil.csv) contains the following variables: VehicleID, Manufacturing_Lot, PSI (pounds per square inch).
This analysis will review production data for insights that might help the manufacturing team.
